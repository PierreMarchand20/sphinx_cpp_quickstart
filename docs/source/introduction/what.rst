Compiled language
=================

C++ is a `compiled language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language>`_, files containing C++ source code are designed to be compiled, meaning that: to be understood by a specific computer, they need to be translated to machine language for this specific computer.

Compilers are tools that execute this translation, but they can go even further and try to optimize the machine code it produces from the generic C++ code you wrote. Or they can also keep more information in the machine code to ease debugging, and give warnings when compiling.

.. note:: Other compiled languages are fortran and C, while Python or matlab use a `different strategy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>`_
