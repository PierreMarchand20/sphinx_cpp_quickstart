It is assumed that the reader has a unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS,...). In other words, we assume the reader do not have Windows, but see `About Windows <https://pmarchand.pages.math.cnrs.fr/computertools/introduction/setup.html#about-windows>`_ from `Computer Tools`_ if you are in this case.

I also assume that the reader has basic knowledge about tools such as bash. If this is not the case, we refer to `Computer Tools`_, and in particular its section on `basic tools <https://pmarchand.pages.math.cnrs.fr/computertools/basic_tools/index.html>`_.

.. _sec_follow_along_compilers:

Compilers
---------

C++ is a :ref:`sec_what_compiled_language`, and thus we need tools to translated C++ code to machine language. Compilers are tools that execute this translation, and thus they are necessary to have on your workstation. Examples of such tools are `g++ <https://gcc.gnu.org>`_ and `clang <https://clang.llvm.org>`_. See their documentation for installation instructions. Note that they are very common tools, and thus, they can usually be easily installed, via a package manager for example.


Other tools
-----------

As for most languages, several tools can be used to improve your development environment:

- Syntax colouring,
- Code Formatting,
- Static-analyser,
- Debugger,
- Code completion
- Code navigation,

Visual Studio Code
------------------

Most tools are available or can be integrated with `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_ using the `C/C++ extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools>`_. See also its `documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/introvideos-cpp>`_ on using C++ in VS Code.

If you are not familiar to VS Code, you can also check out `this section <https://pmarchand.pages.math.cnrs.fr/computertools/introduction/setup.html#visual-studio-code>`_ from `Computer Tools`_.
