Object-oriented programming
###########################

`Object-oriented programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`__  (OOP)is a programming paradigm where data will be encapsulated in "objects", which also contain functions to interact with the data. These functions are called "methods" and we already saw examples of such functions when using ``std::vector`` and ``std::array`` in :ref:`stl/container:arrays`.

Object-oriented programming allows defining a specific interface to interact with a set of data.
