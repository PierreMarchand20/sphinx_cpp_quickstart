Other types of containers
#########################

As you may know, there are many types of data containers, which may have different operations available, with different complexities. Here are a few examples (see also `documentation <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container>`_): 

- Sequential containers: array, vector, linked list, ...
- Associative containers: set, map, ...
- Container adaptors: stack, queue, ...

Choosing the right type of container is a problem-dependent, it depends on the type of operations you need, and their cost. You can find most of the types of containers available in the STL.
