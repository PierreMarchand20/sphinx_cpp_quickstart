C++ Standard Library
####################

As we have already quickly seen, one strength of C++ is its `C++ Standard Library <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header>`__ which contains strings, (`Strings library <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string>`__), common data structures (`Container library <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container>`__), algorithms (`Algorithms library <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm>`__), and common mathematical functions and types, such as complex number, random generators (`Numerics library <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric>`__). 

We review here a few features available.
