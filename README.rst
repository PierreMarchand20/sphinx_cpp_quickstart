C++ Quick Start
===============

The purpose of this document is to give a good starting point to learn C++. It will focus on basic features of the language, using modern good practices. References to more advanced features may be given.

It is inspired by other tutorials focusing on "Modern C++" (at least C++14...). Here are a few references:

- Videos of Kate Gregory like `Stop teaching C <https://youtu.be/YnWhqhNdYyk>`__ 
- `LearnCpp.com <https://www.learncpp.com>`__
- `C++ reference <https://cppreference.com>`__ and his examples.
- `Microsoft documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-170>`_
